What's the first thing you do when you wake up? Do you brush your teeth? Do you take a shower? Maybe
you go straight for the grinder to make a good 'ol cup of joe?

Have you ever wondered *why* you do these things?

No really, I'm serious. Where do your habits come from? Common sense? Societal norms? Because your
mom told you to? Whatever your answer, I'm quite positive it didn't include the word *advertising*.
Yup! You may not realize it, but an uncomfortable percentage of your morning ritual exists, at least
in part, due to marketing. Don't believe me? Consider:

**Showering Daily** |br|
Today, it's pretty much accepted that showering daily is the norm [#]_, but did you know that that
you `don't really need to`_? The main reason that the majority of Americans do so can be traced
back to the mid-twentieth century, when the soap industry spent a fortune 
`selling the idea that a daily wash was essential for your health`_.

**Mouthwash** |br|
The `Simmons National Consumer Survey`_ reported that almost 200 million people used mouthwash in
2016. In the 1920s, mouthwash wasn't even in the vocabulary of most Americans. In between? A 
`pretty mean`_ (and very successful) marketing campaign by Listerine.

**Toothpaste** |br|
The science on dental hygiene stands crystal clear: brushing your teeth undoubtedly leaves them
better off [#]_. Even so, did you know that in the early 1900s only a small percentage of Americans
`even owned a toothbrush`_? It took an ad man, Claude C. Hopkins, who introduced *Pepsodent* to 
America, before we finally `developed the habit`_.

How to Transition from Bathroom Products to Media Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So why am I telling you this? Am I just a weirdo with a fetish for bathroom trivia? Well I am, but
more importantly, I also wanted to bring home a simple point: media is effective; it's effective in
getting us to buy more soap, it's effective in making us care about Jon Snow, and it's even 
effective in shaping our view of the world [#]_.

John Oliver, host of the HBO show *Last Week Tonight*, explores this last idea quite a bit.

One such story ran in early July 2017, where John reviewed the Sinclair Broadcast Group. For the
uninitiated (or those that don't have HBO), here's a bullet point summary of the episode:

-----------

This makes sense. 

For a controlled study, a researcher needs to make sure they reliably expose one group to a single
media source while simultaneously making sure that they do the opposite for a second group.
Furthermore, the researcher needs to control for other factors that might affect political
sentiment, of which there are plenty. 

I'm sure you probably have your own mental images of various people in the US; you imagine that a
middle-aged white man from a coal-town in Virginia would most likely have a different political
attitude when compared to a young black woman raised in California. Not to mention controlling for
general political trends; if a Democratic leader comes under fire for a scandal, it wouldn't be
surprising to observe political sentiment shift away from Democrats in general, no matter what news
source each group consumes.

There is ,however, a way to get around a lot of those barriers without spending heaps of money 
trying to correctly collect data. And that is...

Have you ever heard of `Blue Feed, Red Feed`_? If I had to describe the site in a single line, I'd
go with something like:

  "A guide to human biases and heuristics: American politics edition."

By now, if you haven't rushed to click on the link above (even after reading that amazing tag line)
I'd suggest you do. Spend a few minutes and explore. It's ok, I'll wait.

Ready?

Now, wasn't that an interesting experience? For those wanting an explanation (or for those with an
unwavering refusal to click on things even when asked nicely) "Blue Feed, Red Feed" is a
collaborative effort by Facebook researchers and the Wall Street Journal to showcase opposing
political newsfeeds side-by-side. Not only is this graphic a great piece of applied data science
but, depending on how you personally use Facebook, it can also be quite the eye opener.

For me, at least, this was the case. I've known for some time that bias existed in the news stories
I read, but it didn't invoke a sense of legitimacy until I saw this graphic and started digging
deeper.

Of course, I'm not the first person ever interested in measuring the effects of bias [#]_ [#]_.
Nevertheless, I hope this series of blog posts can help put a number
