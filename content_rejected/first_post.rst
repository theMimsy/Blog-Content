Meaning of the Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fun fact: did you know I almost named this blog *I Have No Idea What I'm Doing*? The reasons for
this are pretty self explanatory, but let me list them out anyways:

- I didn't have any experience in managing a website. 
- I didn't have any real writing experience. 
- I barely knew how data science and data visualization worked. 
  
Let's just say that the month before this site went live was a real learning experience.  In the
end, I decided on *mimsy* as the name because:

1. It's short and easy to remember.
2. I like the way it sounds.
3. I didn't know that search engine optimization was a thing.

It's only after creating the site that I learned *mimsy* was an actual English word! I was hoping
for something with a positive meaning, but the English language is not so kind.

*mimsy*:

  prim, underwhelming, and ineffectual

Welp, they say that language is fluid and meanings change all the time. Crossing my fingers on that
one.

My Media Diet is Kale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before we go on, I'd like to come clean about something. Yes, we've only known each other for about
5 minutes now, but I feel you're a trustworthy person. You see, no matter how I try to shy away from 
it, a realization has slowly, unceasingly crept into my mind:

    I've been getting nearly 100% of my news from John Oliver's "Last Week Tonight"

Granted, some people might not find this to be huge problem. Yes, he sounds "like a chimney sweeper
passing through a wood chipper" [#]_. And yes, he looks "like a nearsighted parrot who works at a
bank" [#]_. But its no secret to many of his viewers that he and his team consistently report on
stories not in the purview of the general public. Civil forfeiture, the opioid drug epidemic, school
segregation; the list goes on.

However, in terms of media diets, "Last Week Tonight" is a lot like kale. Some people swear by the
stuff; others want to gag at the mere mention of it. You can like kale. You can eat kale for lunch
everyday if you want to. But if I open your fridge only to find a giant frozen block of kale, and
then I trip over boxes full of kale-chips as I stagger away in horror, and oh my god why are you
putting kale into my socks!

...

Erm, well, what I'm trying to say is that people should have a diverse diet; media or otherwise. 
In fact, it's because of this
