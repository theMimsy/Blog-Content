I'm Starting a Blog!
====================

Welcome to *mimsy.io*! Just another blog about data science, learning, and general tomfoolery
involving cool visualizations. 

Like many blogs, this site doesn't have much structure. However, I do file the different post under
different categories. If you need some guidance, theses are the different types of posts I'll be
writing:

- `Announcements <category/announcements.html>`_: Post like this one that provide information about
  the site itself.
- `Stories <category/stories.html>`_: Posts that read more like news articles. Here, I take a story
  I've heard somewhere else and try to explore it further using data.
- `Notebooks <category/notebooks.html>`_: Blog post versions of JUPYTER notebooks. I usually post
  these a supplementary material to other posts (like *Stories*). These involve code (usually **R**
  or **Python**) and detail steps I took to create graphs, maps, and visualizations.
- `Tutorials <category/tutorials.html>`_: Post where I explore and try to explain various topics in
  data science, statistics, and machine learning.

As of right now, there's not much content on the site, but this will hopefully change soon!
